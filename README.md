## Course Summary

#### GAN (Generative Adversarial Network):
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a cool type of AI introduced in 2014. They work with two teams of neural networks: the generator and the discriminator. The generator tries to make fake data like images, and the discriminator tries to tell if the data is real or fake. They play a game together where the generator gets better at making realistic data, and the discriminator gets better at spotting fakes. This teamwork helps GANs create realistic-looking data, which can be used for lots of things like making fake photos or enhancing real ones.

#### CNN (Convolutional Neural Network): 
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are smart computer programs mainly used for recognizing and understanding images. They work kind of like our brain does when we see things. CNNs use special layers to look at different parts of a picture and figure out what's important. They're super useful for things like identifying objects in photos, analyzing medical images, or even driving cars by recognizing what's around them.

#### DCGAN (Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network):
Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGANs) are a fancy type of GAN made specifically for creating realistic pictures. They use deep learning and special layers to make sure the images they create look really good. By working together, these networks can create images that look just like real ones, even though they're actually made by a computer. DCGANs are used for all sorts of fun stuff, like making art or generating new designs.
